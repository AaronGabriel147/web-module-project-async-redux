X    Build a React Redux app
    Fetch data inside an async action creator from an API of your choosing
    Add the data from the API to the Redux store
    Display the data from the store in a component
    Some styling must be applied. It can be basic, but the app must not only use browser default stylings






 This is the chance to let your skills shine! You have learned sooo much the last month, and now you get to put all of your hard-earned skills to work. Choose an open api (this list has a lot of great ones - look for ones with Auth: no and HTTPS: yes - or just do a google search for open apis). Protip - don't take too long choosing an API. Pick one that looks interesting, and get building.
